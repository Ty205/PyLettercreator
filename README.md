# PyLettercreator
A simple application to create letters in Python.
## How to use.
This application is very simple to use. Once you run 'main.py', you will be prompted with a few fields. After filling out all of them, your letter will be generated. If the file already exists, you will get notified of this and the letter will not be created.
